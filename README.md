#World Chat Project

World Chat Project is a simple application created for study purposes using Node.js that allows people in the same network chat.

###For now, features include:
* Defining a username 
* Sending messages to everyone connected

###TODO:
* Improve layout
* Persist messages
* Why not encrypt them also?
* Send messages to specific users
* Enable send images and some basic HTML processing(bold, etc) (HTML processing was disabled to prevent XSS attacks)
